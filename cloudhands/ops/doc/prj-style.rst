Style templates
===============

Considered the frameworks mentioned in reviews at webgranth_ and codegeekz_ against these
criteria:

* Driven by open standards (HTML5 and CSS3).
* Styled for desktop rather than mobile platforms.
* Favouring a RESTful architecture rather than one-page web apps.
* Compatible with a Python framework (not tied to back ends like node.js or PHP).
