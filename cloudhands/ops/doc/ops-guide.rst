When it's done right, the packaging and deployment of Python software
can be quick and reliable.

But there are some traps to avoid. Innocuous aspects such as naming and
versioning have caused difficulties for the unwary.

Luckily, best practice has been documented in these PEPs:

* `Structural and naming conventions for Python packages`_
* `Format specifications for package versioning`_
 
.. _Structural and naming conventions for Python packages: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0423/
.. _Format specifications for package versioning: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/
