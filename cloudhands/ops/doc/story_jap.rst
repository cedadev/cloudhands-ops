User Story: JASMIN Analysis Package
===================================

As a scientist working for STFC I want my analytics processes to run where
they have access to JASMIN storage so I can apply my models to a particular
dataset.

Elaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Predefined vCloud template contains standard JASMIN analysis package
* Ability to measure readiness of a node
* Ability to configure node with software, process configuration
* Alerting on conditions (ready, finished, error)

Tasks
~~~~~

* Hands-on JASMIN AP
* Hands-on example analytics code
* Explore deploy code
* Explore data access
* Explore process control and events
* Identify indicators
